# Bad block calculator

Simple bash script helping to locate bad blocks on the partition


This script's functionality is based on the [Smartmontools instructions](https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/BadBlockHowto#ext2ext3firstexample) on how to locate bad blocks and reallocate them. After doing several times, required to google that doc each time, I decided to make a simple script which will be easy enough to locate and reuse.

Feel free to use and improve it.
